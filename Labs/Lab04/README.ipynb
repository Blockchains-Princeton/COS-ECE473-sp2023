    "# Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "- Interacting with various types of on-chain exchanges as a trader\n",
    "\n",
    "# Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "- Metamask extension should be installed on the browser and funded with ETH\n",
    "- If not, install Metamask from [here](https://metamask.io/) and fund it using the faucet [here](https://goerlifaucet.com/)\n",

    "# Trading on decentralized exchange applications\n",
    "\n",
    "Decentralized exchanges can be categorized into two broad categories:\n",
    "- Dapps mimicking traditional centralized exchanges and implementing an order book\n",
    "- Dapps running DeFi native exchange formats such as AMMs\n",
    "In this lab, we will interact with one exchange of each of the above types through their web app.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Trade on an order book exchange\n",
    "\n",
    "Order book exchange enables trading by running sequential trades on an order book. The order book contains *bids* from agents who want to buy an asset, and *asks* from agents who want to sell the asset. A trade occurs when a bid matches an ask. One can perform two primary types of orders on such an exchange. \n",
    "- A *market order* is an order that executes the trade at the best available bid or asks.\n",
    "- A *limit order* that sets a bid or ask on an order book that is executed at a price within limits set by the order.\n",
    "\n",
    "An order book exchange requires a lot of data and computing to maintain its state; hence it is not implemented entirely on an L1 blockchain. Implementations typically rely on an L2 to scale. In this lab, we will interact with Degate, an order book DEX implemented on a zk rollup on the Goerli testnet. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Open [Degate testnet app](https://testnet.degate.com/trade/USDC/ETH)\n",
    "- Click on the top-right corner to connect your metamask wallet \n",
    "- Register the wallet (Wallet registration is equivalent to opening up an account)\n",
    "- Deposit 0.1 ETH to the exchange\n",
    "- Wait for 12 block confirmations (Why is a 12 block confirmation required?)\n",
    "- Check transaction status on etherscan - block confirmations\n",
    "\n",
    "Registration and deposit procedures look very similar to a centralized exchange since the transactions within the exchange are not posted on the ethereum blockchain but instead happen on their Zk-rollup. We will go through rollups in a future lecture; for now, imagine the registration and ETH deposits as initiating states on a dedicated state machine that runs the Degate exchange. 12 block confirmations ensure that ETH transfer is secure enough to show up on their rollup's state. You have effectively transferred 0.01 ETH from your account to their rollup contract, and your metamask will effectively deduct it from your wallet. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once 12 block confirmations are complete, drop down from the wallet tab and click on assets. It should show the deposited ETH. Note that you automatically have 200 USDC and USDT in your account; this is just a bonus from their faucet. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will now be performing a market order. Please follow the steps below: \n",
    "- Select market order on the right\n",
    "- Trade 0.01 ETH for USDC - Click on sell and set 0.01ETH\n",
    "- Notice in the lower right corner that your ETH balance has decreased, and your USDC balance has increased\n",
    "- Go to Wallet(*your public key*)-> Orders -> Order history and check the order details (last column)\n",
    "- Note the fees are in USDC since these are exchange fees and not a tx fee on Ethereum - this tx is not posted on the Ethereum(Goerli) blockchain\n",
    "\n",
    "We will now perform a limit order. Please follow the steps below:\n",
    "- Sell 0.08 ETH at a limit of Market price + 0.1 USDC\n",
    "- (Click on limit, get the market price from the ticker at the top left, set price = market price + 0.1, set amount as 0.08ETH, click on sell)\n",
    "- Go to Wallet(*your public key*)-> Orders -> Open orders \n",
    "- If the price does not go to the market price + 0.1 USDC in some time, cancel the order (last column)\n",
    "- Check balances - the order may not be executed\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we want to withdraw all funds from the exchange, \n",
    "- Sell all USDC at market price\n",
    "- (Click on Buy, select market, drop down from amount to select total, set total to be equal to your USDC balance, and click Buy)\n",
    "- Trade may not happen if the market is not deep enough - not enough asks (Slippage warning may trigger)\n",
    "- Withdraw all ETH by selecting withdraw on the bottom right of the page, and set the amount as Max - gas fees. \n",
    "- Leave room for gas fees since there is an implementation flaw that does not automatically reduce gas fees from the withdrawal amount\n",
    "\n",
    "## Trade on an AMM\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be contrasting the above trading experience with Uniswap. Uniswap is an AMM; its implementation is lightweight by design; hence, it can be implemented entirely on an L1 blockchain such as Ethereum. As a contract with Denet, trading on Uniswap does not require an account since it interacts directly with the wallet. Let us perform a simple ETH-UNI trade on Uniswap. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Open the Uniswap app and select swap at [https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap](https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap)\n",
    "- Connect your metamask wallet on the top right\n",
    "- Select ETH as the token you would supply and UNI as the exchange token\n",
    "- Check funds on metamask\n",
    "- Perform trade with 0.01 GoerliETH - the order is a market order by default\n",
    "- Click on swap and confirm the transaction on metamask\n",
    "- Select the txid link (on the top-right Pending tab) on Uniswap and observe the trade transaction on Etherscan \n",
    "- The trade should show pending and should be successful in less than 30 sec\n",
    "- Check metamask for withdrawn GoerliETH \n",
    "- Metamask won't show the UNI token; we need to import it \n",
    "- Get the ERC20 contract address from the transaction on Etherscan (0x1f9840a85d5aF5bf1D1762F925BDADdC4201F984)\n",
    "- Add it with base 0 on metamask, check the status of UNI tokens on metamask \n",
    "- Trade all UNI for GoerliETH\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that all interactions are visible through your metamask wallet since they occur on the Goerli blockchain. AMMs like Uniswap also allow anyone to create their trading pair, enabling exchanges for long-tail assets such as LUSD and LETH. We have created a trading pair to exchange LETH-LUSD. To perform trades on this trading pair, follow the steps below:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Click on the [swap](https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap) tab.\n",
    "- Paste the LETH contract address on the from tab (0xb85154E1948e52214A5F134172358Fb5010F6282)\n",
    "- Paste the LUSD contract address on the to tab (0x4966Bb6Cd9f3e042331b0798525b7970eFB0D94A)\n",
    "- You would need to approve LETH tokens to be used by the Uniswap contract; click on approve and confirm on Metamask.\n",
    "- Once approval is complete, swap 1 LETH by clicking on the swap tab and confirming the transaction on Metamask\n",
    "- Check asset balance changes on Metamask"
