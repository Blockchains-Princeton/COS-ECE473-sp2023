    "\n",
    "- Explore decentralized governance platforms\n",
    "- Understand the ERC20Votes extension\n",
    "- Understand DAO governance contracts \n",
    "- Participate in a vote \n",
    "\n",
    "# Prerequisites:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 0.1 GETH to participate in voting (for transaction fees)\n",
    "- 10 LabETH as governance tokens to participate in voting \n",

    "# Exploring a DAO on Tally \n",
    "\n",
    "Tally is one of the leading DAO governance platforms. It allows governance token holders to interface with voting proposals and provides analytics and an interface with vote delegation. We will explore existing voting proposals. Please follow the steps below:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Open Tally at [https://www.tally.xyz/](https://www.tally.xyz/)\n",
    "- Click on `Explore DAOs`\n",
    "- Click on `Uniswap` to go to Uniswap's DAO \n",
    "- Look at Proposal 29 [Fix the Cross Chain Messaging Bridge on Arbitrum](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/uniswap/proposal/29)\n",
    "- Observe that the types of votes are split into 3 types: For, Against, and Abstain.\n",
    "- Observe the voting timeline, the quorum threshold, and the decision made since the vote passed the quorum threshold, it passed. The quorum threshold determines the amount of For votes needed for the proposal to pass\n",
    "- The proposal also has a description attached along with an executable code: In this case execution code sends a cross-chain message to update an address \n",
    "- This transaction was executed since the vote passed \n",
    "\n",
    "# Interacting with a DAO\n",
    "\n",
    "## Wrapping to a governance token\n",
    "\n",
    "We have set up a DAO with LabETH as a governance token. The DAO can be found [here](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/cos-ece473-2023-dao-ntl). We cannot directly use LabETH since it is missing a few properties needed to be a token that can participate in voting; these are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Capability to query balances at a past block number. This capability is needed since voting power for a proposal is frozen at a given block number to prevent a double-spending attack \n",
    "- Capability to delegate your vote. This capability is needed since most DAO governance rules enable voting by delegates - we cannot expect most small token owners to be direct participants in governance. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since LabETH was not set up with an ERC20Votes extension, we need to wrap it into an ERC20 contract that has the extension. We will be using the [LabETHgov wrapper](https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0xf4b4e230d2b4efa45fea441b29762d8a0f47e00d). Please follow the steps below to wrap LabETH: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Go the the LabETH contract at [https://goerli.etherscan.io/token/0xb85154e1948e52214a5f134172358fb5010f6282?a=0x13AE19C3b94E4Ccfe97448effe760f8D88a48A0b](https://goerli.etherscan.io/token/0xb85154e1948e52214a5f134172358fb5010f6282?a=0x13AE19C3b94E4Ccfe97448effe760f8D88a48A0b) and click on `Write contract`\n",
    "- Connect your wallet and select `Approve`\n",
    "- Set the sender address as the address of the LabETHgov wrapper: 0xf4b4E230d2B4EFa45FEA441b29762d8A0f47e00D\n",
    "- Set the value as 10 LabETH: 10000000000000000000\n",
    "- Click on Write to post the transaction \n",
    "- Go to LabETHgov wrapper contract at: (https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0xf4b4e230d2b4efa45fea441b29762d8a0f47e00d)[https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0xf4b4e230d2b4efa45fea441b29762d8a0f47e00d]\n",
    "- Click on `Write contract.`\n",
    "- Select `depositFor`, set the account address as your wallet address (same as the one used for approval), and set the amount to 10 LabETH: 10000000000000000000\n",
    "- Click on write; once the transaction is posted, it will transfer 10 LabETH into the contract and mint 10 LabETHgov tokens. \n",
    "- Add LabETHgov tokens to your wallet by going to `Assets` and then clicking on `Import tokens`, set the address to 0xf4b4E230d2B4EFa45FEA441b29762d8A0f47e00D\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exploring DAO creation and governance contracts\n",
    "\n",
    "Tally allows us to add a DAO to its interface. In order to do that, we click `Add a DAO.` The interface asks us to link to a governor contract. A governor contract is a rule book on voting. We will examine the governor contract for the Lab's DAO : [COS/ECE473-2023-DAO-NTL](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/cos-ece473-2023-dao-ntl).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Open the governor contract at [https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0xee220dbeb62e9fb8b14be2eebfd5851794207dcb](https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0xee220dbeb62e9fb8b14be2eebfd5851794207dcb)\n",
    "- We will explore the code of the governor contract\n",
    "- The contract sets the `token` used for governance, a `QuorumFraction` as a percentage of forVotes (from the totalSupply) needed for a proposal to pass, and a `TimelockController` contract which ensures that the execution of the proposal is made after a delay\n",
    "- It also sets the `VotingDelay` as the future block number at which the voting power snapshot is taken\n",
    "- `votingPeriod` determines how long the voting period is and,\n",
    "- `proposalThreshold` determines who can create a proposal by setting a minimum threshold on governance tokens\n",
    "\n",
    "A DAO is mapped one-to-one with a governor contract. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Delegating your votes \n",
    "\n",
    "The governor contract deployed allows voting from delegates. For this lab, students can self-delegate: and vote on proposals directly. Please follow the following steps to delegate your votes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Go to the DAO page at [https://www.tally.xyz/gov/cos-ece473-2023-dao-ntl](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/cos-ece473-2023-dao-ntl)\n",
    "- Select `Delegate vote` on the top right\n",
    "- Select `Delegate to myself` and confirm the transaction on metamask \n",
    "- This step is needed before the TA proceeds to the next section. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Voting on a proposal \n",
    "\n",
    "The TA will create a proposal using Tally. We will click on creating a new proposal; each proposal can have an execute action and a description. We will set a simple execute operation: transferring tokens from the governance contracts to an address (say, as a fundraising proposal). Once the proposal is launched, it should be visible under active proposals on the [DAO's page](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/cos-ece473-2023-dao-ntl). Please follow the steps below to vote:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Click on the proposal titled `LabVote`\n",
    "- Select `Vote` on the top right\n",
    "- You should see your voting power as 10 if you successfully delegate yourself \n",
    "- Vote randomly \n",
    "\n",
    "We will be able to see the votes cast and the final result of the proposal. Once the voting deadline is passed, anyone can run execute to enable the transfer. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Alternate DAO governance platforms\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to rising Ethereum gas fees, costs to vote on-chain have become unbearably expensive, hindering small token-holders from participating in the governance process. [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/) is an off-chain multi-governance client that enables gasless voting for DAOs. Anyone can create a proposal or vote on an existing one with a simple signature stored on IPFS rather than an on-chain transaction, making DAO governance more affordable and accessible to the average community member.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, because Snapshot uses off-chain voting, a smart contract does not automatically enforce the voting result on-chain. Instead, trust is placed in the project team to execute the voting result. Effectively, Snapshot serves as a pool where the power of execution is still delegated to other parties, making it somewhat centralized. Nevertheless, until network fees become negligible, Snapshot offers a practical and cost-effective solution for DeFi projects to allow community members to participate in the governance process."
