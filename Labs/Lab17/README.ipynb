    "In this lab, we will be taking a deep dive into an ERC 721 contract and understanding how an NFT is stored. We will looking at an NFT collection called [Doodles](https://opensea.io/collection/doodles-official); their contract can be found at [https://etherscan.io/address/0x8a90cab2b38dba80c64b7734e58ee1db38b8992e#code](https://etherscan.io/address/0x8a90cab2b38dba80c64b7734e58ee1db38b8992e#code). Please follow the steps below:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Visit this contract, specifically looking at `Doodles.sol` and `ERC721.sol`.\n",
    "- Specifically, note and understand the connection between the `setBaseURI` method in `Doodles.sol` and the `tokenURI` method in `ERC721.sol`, which is what allows the storage of a URI for each token's metadata.\n",
    "- Access the read contract tab, and call the Token URI method on a token id of your choice other than 1.\n",
    "- Example output for token id 1: `ipfs://QmPMc4tcBsMqLRuCQtPmPe84bpSjrC3Ky7t3JWuHXYB4aS/1`\n",
    "- This is the IPFS URI where the token's metadata is stored (off-chain). You will submit this URI as part of this lab's submission. To access this link within your browser, you will generate a URL using Cloudflare's IPFS gateway. To do so, replace `ipfs://` with `https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/` for your token URI.\n",
    "  - Example:\n",
    "  https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/QmPMc4tcBsMqLRuCQtPmPe84bpSjrC3Ky7t3JWuHXYB4aS/1\n",

    "- You can repeat this process with the \"image\" value in the metadata to find the image URL for the NFT that is stored off-chain. This process highlights that images/metadata are not always stored on-chain; the NFT is just the token itself - not the media stored alongside it.\n",

    "# Viewing an \"On-Chain\" NFT Collection\n",
    "\n",
    "Some NFT collections generate their image data on-chain; we will take a look at the Pixels collection on OpenSea as an example: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Access and interact with a project called The Pixels on OpenSea: https://opensea.io/collection/the-pixels-inc. \n",
    "- Examine the contract at https://etherscan.io/address/0x7ff2a00ff543f913b76010a05b5446e36d403675#code.\n",
    "- Specifically, examine `ThePixelsDNAFactory.sol` where the token images & metadata are programmatically generated on-chain.\n",
    "- Are animations and metadata still stored off-chain on a proprietary API? You can check this using the Token URI method to see where and what metadata is stored.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Minting an NFT\n",
    "\n",
    "We have created a custom NFT contract for this class; it generates images using on-chain logic. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Access our ERC-721 NFT contract at: [https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0x8a7a2547aba5b189cf048b13ace96e7eaac4eebb](https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0x8a7a2547aba5b189cf048b13ace96e7eaac4eebb)\n",
    "- Examine the contract, specifically the `mintNFT` and `generateImage` methods that are not part of the ERC721 standard as well as the overridden `TokenURI` method for the on-chain metadata.\n",
    "- Use the write tab on Etherscan to call the mint method, which will mint an NFT to your address. The cost to mint the NFT is 0.001 Goerli ETH.\n",
    "- Access your NFT's on-chain metadata, and submit the token ID associated with it in this lab's submission.\n",
    "- You can view the token's URI to generate the image. Go to `Read contract` and query your tokenID under the `tokenURI` method. Paste the data on the browser to generate the image. \n",
    "- Note the base64 encoding used for image and metadata generation: abi.encodePacked(\n",
    "        \"data:image/svg+xml;base64,\",\n",
    "        Base64.encode(svg)\n",
    "      )\n",

    "\n",
    "# Introduction to IPFS\n",
    "\n",
    "Off-chain storage is critical to the NFT ecosystem. NFTs being unique, prefer IPFS since it is a content-addressable storage platform. We will look at how to interact with IPFS using Pinata.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Access Pinata IPFS platform by going to [https://app.pinata.cloud/pinmanager](https://app.pinata.cloud/pinmanager) and setting up an account. \n",
    "- Upload any image by clicking on `Add Files`\n",
    "- Note the content ID generated by the image - this will be consistent across different gateways\n",
    "- Use Cloudflare gateway to view the stored image: https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/content-id\n",
