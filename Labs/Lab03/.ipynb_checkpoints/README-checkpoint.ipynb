    "Verified contracts on Etherscan allow you to interact with functions on the contract.\n",
    "Open the LabFaucet contract by providing its address: 0x4290913D2f785921A341995f66817Ec252D4eE13. You can now access the contract's read and write functions.\n",
    "Go to the ``write tab``, connect your metamask wallet, and call the ``requestTokens`` function by providing the LabUSD token's contract address. Confirm the transaction on the metamask prompt. Check confirmation of the associated transaction on Etherscan. \n",

    "# Importing tokens to Metamask\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that the ERC20 tokens are not added to your metamask address by default. This happens because Metamask needs to know what tokens to look out for. Once imported, your LabUSD and LabETH tokens can be tracked and transferred using Metamask. To import tokens to metamask, perform the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Go to the assets tab and select ``import tokens`` at the bottom of the screen.\n",
    "- Enter the smart contract address for ERC20 tokens we would be using in the class: [LabUSD](https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0x4966bb6cd9f3e042331b0798525b7970efb0d94a) and [LabETH](https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0xb85154e1948e52214a5f134172358fb5010f6282)\n",

    "\n",
    "Assume you are going on a vacation and need to book travel and accommodation. We have created two contracts mimicking a decentralized application for booking accommodation and travel. The hotel reservation contract can be found [here](https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0x2a9d2b2fb9e1d897281a12d98037f61fff941cd5). Let us go through its main ``bookRoom()`` function\n",
    "\n",
    "- Initial few checks ensure the payment is sufficient and rooms are available at the hotel\n",
    "- The state of the contract is updated to make sure the room is booked in the name of the wallet initiating the transaction calling the function\n",
    "- The last part calculates and disburses a refund if the transaction caller sent more money than the ticket price of `10**10 wei`.\n",
    "- Note that no part of the contract allows for cancellation of the reservation; this Dapp corresponds to a Non-refundable reservation\n",
    "\n",
    "You will now book accommodation for the trip. \n",
    "- Go to the contract on Etherscan, click the write contract tab, and connect your wallet. - - Click the [bookRoom()](https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0x2a9d2b2fb9e1d897281a12d98037f61fff941cd5#writeContract#F2) tab. \n",
    "- Set the amount of Wei to send as a payment. The required payment is `10000000000 wei` or `0.00000001 ETH`; you can send more if you want, and the contract will refund it within the same transaction.\n",
    "- Check the status of your reservation by querying `CheckReservations` with your public key\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have booked the accommodation, let us book a flight. The flight reservation contract looks similar to the hotel reservation contract with ``bookFlight()`` replacing ``bookRoom()``. You can access the flight reservation contract [here](https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0x009b57fcad73e532e41f940020dee6b0419f38be). Perform the same steps as the hotel reservation contract to book a flight ticket. Check the status of the transaction on Etherscan.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that the transaciton will fail for some of you since there aren't enough flight tickets available for all class members. This leads to a situation where your hotel reservation is practically useless since there is no way to travel. Is it possible to avoid such a situation: *Book hotel only if the flight is available* and *Book flight only if the hotel is available*? In other words, we want the trip reservation to be atomic - Either book both travel and accommodation or book none. Notice that the Dapps are independent of one another - think of them as two separate travel websites. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Atomic transaction\n",
    "\n",
    "We can perform such transactions easily on blockchains. Note that an ethereum transaction either succeeds or fails and reverts back. Thus, we need to combine ``bookRoom()`` and ``bookFlight()`` into a single transaction. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can do this by launching a smart contract whose one function call will call two of the above hotel and flight contracts. The atomic transaction contract (aka trip reservation contract) can be found [here](https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0x45d99f133467c8f6a5b3f0aca029a6e5f0859bb0). Let us quickly go through the ``bookTrip`` function:\n",
    "- The function takes in 4 arguments - the addresses of Hotel and Flight reservation contracts and their prices\n",
    "- It then calls both the hotel and flight contract \n",
    "- The calls are sequential, however, due to the atomic nature of an Ethereum transaction, the whole ``bookTrip`` transaction will fail if either of the contract calls fails.\n",
    "- The last part disburses any remaining refund.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have refreshed both the hotel and flight contracts, and you will now use the atomic transaction contract to book both atomically:\n",
    "- Go to the contract on Etherscan, click the write contract tab, and connect your wallet. - - Click the [bookTrip](https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0x45d99f133467c8f6a5b3f0aca029a6e5f0859bb0#writeContract#F1) tab. \n",
    "- Set the amount of ETH to send as a payment. The required total payment is `20000000000 wei` or `0.00000002 ETH`; anything extra will be refunded. \n",
    "- Give the contract addresses of the hotel and flight reservation contract; set the price of both to ``10000000000`` wei.\n",
    "- Check the status of the transaction on Etherscan\n",
    "\n",
    "The transaction will succeed for some of you and fail for the rest. Check the status of your booking on the respective contracts. If the atomic transaction failed, you should not have confirmed reservations on both the hotel and flight contracts. "
